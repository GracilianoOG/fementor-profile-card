# 💻 Profile Card Component | Frontend Mentor

## 📖 Description

This component was created with HTML, CSS and Sass, using the VSCodium code editor. This challenge was provided by Frontend Mentor. It was made in one day. I wanted to code something simple to remember some basic concepts and to take a break from the courses I finished at freeCodeCamp.

## 🔨 Build with

* HTML
* CSS + Custom Properties
* Sass
* BEM
* Visual Studio Code (Codium)

## ⏳ Continued development

### Some ideas in mind are:

* Improve HTML semantics
* Improve accessibility
* Rework how the background images are displayed
